# Project 2: Create Your Own Image Classifier

In this project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Our target accuracy is 70%, but any accuracy over 50% is a great start.
Some of the benchmark results on CIFAR-10 include:

78.9% Accuracy | [Deep Belief Networks; Krizhevsky, 2010](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/conv-cifar10-aug2010.pdf)

90.6% Accuracy | [Maxout Networks; Goodfellow et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4389.pdf)

96.0% Accuracy | [Wide Residual Networks; Zagoruyko et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf)

99.0% Accuracy | [GPipe; Huang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965.pdf)

98.5% Accuracy | [Rethinking Recurrent Neural Networks and other Improvements for ImageClassification; Nguyen et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15161.pdf)

Research with this dataset is ongoing. Notably, many of these networks are quite large and quite expensive to train.
